# derivative-approximation
Graphical program (Java) to approximate fixed-function derivatives

Graphical Java program created to approximate fixed-function derivatives. 
You can choose parametrical polynomials, sin, sqrt and log functions. 
The code is written using the Object Oriented Java and Java Swing.  
I Recommend NetBeans 11.1, which I used during the development. 

Enjoy! I hope you'll find the code well-written and the program interesting! 
If you need help or you only want to know something more about me or the code, contact me!

The program is in Italian, I hope this is not a problem in usability.

Credits to Leonardo Giambini, my friend and school mate, to have collaborated with me in this project.

This program can be used completely free for learning purposes
